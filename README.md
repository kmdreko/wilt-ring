# Ring Library

## Overview

This library provides source for a multi-producer multi-consumer lock-free ring buffer. It provides a very simple interface for writing and reading from the buffer. The source includes a `Ring_` class, that provides the raw implementation and C-like facilities, as well as a templated `Ring<T>` class for typed reads and writes.
